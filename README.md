# Computational Intelligence Project

## Overview --> TODO
This repository contains the code and analysis for my Computational Intelligence course project, which is divided into four distinct parts, each implemented in MATLAB. Below is an overview of each part:

## Part 1: Fuzzy Linear Controller (FLC) for Satellite Orientation Control
### Objective
The objective of this part is to implement a Fuzzy Linear Controller (FLC) for the control of a satellite's orientation angle.

## Part 2: FLC for Car Obstacle Avoidance
### Objective
In this sub-project, we use FLC to control the direction of a car with the objective of getting it to the desired coordinates whilst avoiding collision with an obstacle.

## Part 3: Regression with TSK Model
### Objective
The third part of the project focuses on regression analysis using the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) models. It is a two-fold part, focusing on 2 datasets. In the simple dataset (5 features), we implement 4 combinations (2 or 3 MF's, Singleton or Polynomial output) of TSK models and evaluate them. In the high-dimensional dataset (81 features) we use feature selection, along with grid search and 5-fold cross validation to optimize the following parameters: number of features to be used, which features will be used, and the cluster radius. We finally use that to train an optimal model.

## Part 4: Classification with TSK Model --> TODO
### Objective
In the fourth and final part of the project, we explore classification tasks using the TSK model. Our objective is to build and evaluate classification models based on the TSK approach.

## Getting Started --> TODO
For each sub-project, you can find detailed instructions on setting up and running the MATLAB code in their respective directories.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have MATLAB installed to run the code in this project.

## Usage
Refer to the specific sub-project directories for usage instructions and examples.

## Results
Detailed results and analysis for each sub-project can be found in their respective directories in the reports.
