# Computational Intelligence Project

## Overview --> TODO
This repository contains the code and analysis for my Computational Intelligence course project, which is divided into four distinct parts, each implemented in MATLAB. Below is an overview of each part:

## Part 1: Fuzzy Linear Controller (FLC) for Satellite Orientation Control
### Objective
The objective of this sub-project is to implement a Fuzzy Linear Controller (FLC) for the control of a satellite's orientation angle.


## Part 2: FLC for Car Obstacle Avoidance--> TODO
### Objective
In this sub-project, we use FLC to control the movement of a car with the objective of avoiding objects and preventing collisions. The FLC aims to navigate the car safely while avoiding obstacles.

## Part 3: Regression with TSK Model--> TODO
### Objective
The third part of the project focuses on regression using the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) model. We will implement and analyze regression tasks using TSK models.

## Part 4: Classification with TSK Model --> TODO
### Objective
In the fourth and final part of the project, we explore classification tasks using the TSK model. Our objective is to build and evaluate classification models based on the TSK approach.

## Getting Started --> TODO
For each sub-project, you can find detailed instructions on setting up and running the MATLAB code in their respective directories.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have MATLAB installed to run the code in this project.

## Usage
Refer to the specific sub-project directories for usage instructions and examples.

## Results
Detailed results and analysis for each sub-project can be found in their respective directories in the reports.
