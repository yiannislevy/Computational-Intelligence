# Computational Intelligence Project

## Overview --> TODO
This repository contains the code and analysis for my Computational Intelligence course project, which is divided into four distinct parts, each implemented in MATLAB. Below is an overview of each part:

## Part 1: Fuzzy Linear Controller (FLC) for Satellite Orientation Control
### Objective
The objective of this part is to implement a Fuzzy Linear Controller (FLC) for the control of a satellite's orientation angle.

## Part 2: FLC for Car Obstacle Avoidance
### Objective
In this sub-project, we use FLC to control the direction of a car with the objective of getting it to the desired coordinates whilst avoiding collision with an obstacle.

## Part 3: Regression with TSK Model
### Objective
The third part of the project focuses on regression analysis using the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) models. It is a two-fold part, focusing on 2 datasets. In the simple dataset (5 features), we implement 4 combinations (2 or 3 MF's, Singleton or Polynomial output) of TSK models and evaluate them. In the high-dimensional dataset (81 features) we use feature selection, along with grid search and 5-fold cross validation to optimize the following parameters: number of features to be used, which features will be used, and the cluster radius. We finally use that to train an optimal model.

## Part 4: Classification with TSK Model
### Objective
In the fourth and final part of the project, we explore classification tasks using the TSK model. This too is a two-fold part, focusing on 2 datasets. In the first, a simple dataset (3 features), we implemented 4 combinations (Class Dependent or Independent, 0.2 or 0.9 cluster radius) of TSK models, and evaluate them. In the high-dimensional dataset (178 features) we utilize the same optimization algorithm as in part 3, feature selection, grid search and 5-fold cross validation. We optimized the number of features to be used, and the cluster radius, and trained an optimized model.

## Results
Detailed results and analysis for each sub-project can be found in their respective directories in the reports.
